# Group18_CDIO-2

As we are using JDK 21 for this project, that requires Windows 10/11 or Windows server 2022/2019/2016, all versions being x64. For macOS, macOS 11/12/13/14 x64 works as well. Furthermore you will need Java installed JDK 21 or higher will work. 

To clone the repository from our Github, you will need the link to the Github: "https://github.com/G00dbo1/Group18\_CDIO-2", and you will need to open your git terminal in an appropriate folder. Afterwards you will need to run the command \textbf{git clone https://github.com/G00dbo1/Group18\_CDIO-2} and this will "download" the program files to that folder.

To compile the code you will need to open the directory of the source files called "src", and from there you can run the command: \textbf{javac *.java}. From there you will need to be in the folder called "Group18\_CDIO-2", and run the command \textbf{java src.Game}

After that the program will ask for the user input as specified and will run as normal. There are no commandline arguments or settings you can change from the terminal.
